**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

一个go的学习项目，想法来源于java中的[flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway)，在java项目中，可以将falyway集成到项目中，随着项目启动而执行flyway的migrate，而通过 `go get github.com/goflyway/goflyway`也能实现在启动go项目时，自动执行sql变更。
